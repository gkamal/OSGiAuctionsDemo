OSGi Live-Coding Demo: Auction Application
==========================================

This project contains the source for the OSGi Live Coding challenge, first delivered by Neil Bartlett at JAX London, Spring 2011.

HEALTH WARNING!!
================

I use the commit history of this Git repository to script my demo and to recover a known state in case of technical problems. This means I frequently rewrite the commit history using "git rebase" to get a clean sequence of demo steps. So if you checkout the code and start building on top of it, you WILL end up with conflicts vs the master branch. If you want to build on this work then you need to maintain your own fork starting with a simple snapshot of the current state.
